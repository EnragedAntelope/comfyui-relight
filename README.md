## üîß Installation

### Using ComfyUI-Manager (Recommended)

1. Open ComfyUI and navigate to the Manager
2. Search for "ReLight" in the available custom nodes
3. Click Install
4. Restart ComfyUI

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Navigate to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory
cd path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comfyui_relight

# Install dependencies
pip install -r comfyui_relight/requirements.txt

# Restart ComfyUI
```

### Dependencies

ReLight works best with high-quality foreground masks. We recommend installing:

- **[ComfyUI Essentials](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials)** - Provides enhanced mask generation and background removal tools
- **[Scipy](https://scipy.org/)** - Required for rim lighting effects (should be installed automatically)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1. **Add the ReLight üí° node** to your workflow (found under category "image/lighting")
2. **Connect your source image**
3. **Connect a foreground mask** (white = subject, black = background)
4. **Select a preset** like "Rim Light (Behind)" or design your own lighting
5. **Adjust settings** to taste
6. **Preview your results** in real-time

### Sample Workflow

![Sample Workflow](https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfyui-relight/blob/main/example%20workflow.json)

The repository includes a sample workflow file (`example workflow.json`) that demonstrates:

1. Loading an image
2. Removing the background using ComfyUI Essentials' RemBG nodes
3. Applying the ReLight node with "Warm Sunset Glow" preset in "Behind Subject" mode
4. Viewing the results through both standard preview and debug visualization

Simply load this workflow in ComfyUI to see ReLight in action!

## üì∏ Examples

### Dramatic Three-Point RGB Lighting

![Before/After Three-Point RGB Lighting (_in case you really want to overdo things_)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65024b82-2ba2-465e-9505-ca2025b93764)

This example uses three colored lights to create a purposely over the top striking RGB lighting setup:

- **Main Settings**: 
  - 3 light sources
  - "Behind Subject" light direction
  - 2.0 effect strength

- **Light 1 (Red)**: 
  - Position: far right (0.99, 0.15)
  - RGB Color: (255, 0, 0)
  - High intensity (2.0)

- **Light 2 (Green)**:
  - Position: left side (0.2, 0.3)
  - RGB Color: (255, 0, 0)
  - Medium intensity (0.7)

- **Light 3 (Blue)**:
  - Position: bottom center (0.3, 0.8)
  - RGB Color: (0, 0, 255)
  - Low intensity (0.2)

This setup creates vibrant color separation while maintaining the "Behind Subject" mode to emphasize the edges of the figure with dramatic rim lighting.

### Other Lighting Ideas to Try

Here are some additional lighting scenarios that showcase ReLight's versatility:

#### Split Lighting Portrait
![Brighten a subject and make it pop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1d81a70-0c10-460a-bd57-e6c78472a7e9)

Create dramatic portrait lighting with a strong contrast between light and shadow:
- Single light source at position (0.05, 0.5)
- Large outer radius (0.8)
- High contrast (25)
- Reduced saturation (-15)
- "In Front of Subject" light direction

#### Sunset Silhouette
![Spidey outlined by the sun](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed5851a-3607-46c1-a1ba-eb3d297733d4)

Create a beautiful sunset silhouette effect:
- Light positioned low and centered (0.5, 0.9)
- Warm colors (255, 180, 100) (enable "use colored lights")
- "Behind Subject" light direction
- High rim amplification (3.0)
- Moderate mask blur (60)

#### Atmospheric Fog Light
![Creature with foggy lighting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db0d51da-6e9f-4359-9af0-2213954e010e)

Simulate light breaking through fog or mist:
- Light positioned high (0.5, 0.1)
- Cool blue-white color (200, 220, 255) (enable "use colored lights")
- "In Front of Subject" light direction
- High mask blur (100)
- Gradient mode enabled
- Medium intensity (1.5)

#### Moonlight Through Window
![Note hair illumination from moonlight in "After" image on right](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e6e941c-9ea8-437e-bbcc-9fef3747dca4)

Simulate soft moonlight streaming through a window:
- Light positioned at upper corner (0.8, 0.2)
- Cool blue color (120, 150, 255) (enable "use colored lights")
- Gradient mode enabled
- Low brightness (-10)
- High blue cast (Temperature -30)


## üí° Pro Tips

- **Layer Multiple Lights** - Use several ReLight nodes in sequence for complex lighting setups
- **Debug View** - Enable `show_debug_info` to visualize light positions and better understand the effect
- **Mask Quality Matters** - The better your foreground mask, the more realistic your lighting effects
- **Combine with ControlNet** - Use ReLight results as input for ControlNet for guided image generation
- **Perfect Rim Lighting** - For the best rim effects:
  1. Position light behind subject
  2. Use "Behind Subject" light direction
  3. Increase rim_amplification for stronger edges
  4. Keep mask_blur values low (20-40) for crisp edges
